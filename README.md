*System performance* is the amount of useful work done by a system - measured by the production speed of products of a predefined quality. System performance often boosts the competitiveness for high-tech Cyber-Physical Systems. To meet market demands for product quality, product customization and total cost of ownership per product, systems need to meet ever more ambitious performance targets relating to system productivity.

## Managing System Performance

Successfully managing performance ensures that your system is efficiently using resources and that your server provides the best possible services to your users and to your business needs. Moreover, effective performance management can help you quickly respond to changes in your system and can save you money by postponing costly upgrades and service fees.

## How Do You Know if You Need System Performance Monitoring?

Almost everyone needs some sort of regular *[System Performance](https://github.com/digitalltrend/system.performance)* monitoring, no matter how small their organization. In most cases, smaller businesses can use software that automatically tests the system and provides alerts and if anything is found amiss. Many of these types of software can perform data backups and give you regular updates on the amount of server space or memory left on your system.

Larger organizations and those supporting large servers may need to look for more intensive solutions. However, because there is so much more at stake, the cost of a proprietary system is easily offset by the damage that might occur if something goes wrong.
